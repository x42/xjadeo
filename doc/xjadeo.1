.SH NAME
xjadeo \- X Jack Video Monitor
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xjadeo
[ \fI\,OPTIONS \/\fR] [ \fI\,video-file \/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
xjadeo \- the X Jack Video Monitor
.PP
Xjadeo is a software video player that displays a video clip synchronized to an
external time source (MTC, LTC, JACK transport).
.PP
Xjadeo is intended for soundtrack composition, video monitoring and useful for
any task that requires to synchronizing movie frames with audio events.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-A\fR, \fB\-\-avverbose\fR
Display verbose video decoder messages.
.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-ontop\fR
Keep xjadeo window on top of other applications.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-no\-letterbox\fR
Scale movie to fit window. Without this option a
letterbox is used to retain the aspect ratio.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
Print development related information.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR <name>, \fB\-\-midi\-driver\fR <name>
Specify midi driver to use. Run 'xjadeo \fB\-V\fR' to
list supported driver(s). <name> is case insensitive
and can be shortened to the first unique name.
eg '\-d j' for jack, '\-d alsa\-r' for alsa\-raw
.TP
\fB\-f\fR <val>, \fB\-\-screen\-fps\fR <val>
Desired refresh rate of the video display in frames
If this value is equal or less than zero, xjadeo
will use the FPS of the video file as its update
frequency (which is the default).
Note: This does not affect screen/vblank sync.
Synchronizing to the screen's vertical refresh is
hardware dependent (and always used if available).
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display this help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-I\fR, \fB\-\-ignore\-file\-offset\fR
This option is only useful for video files with a
start offset, such as split vob files.
Per default xjadeo honors offsets specified in the
video file header. This option allows one to
override (and subtract) this offset to align the
start of the file with timecode 00:00:00:00.
.TP
\fB\-i\fR <int>, \fB\-\-info\fR <int>
Display time information using the OSD (on screen
display).
0:Off, 1: Frame number, 2: Timecode, 3: both.
.TP
\fB\-J\fR, \fB\-\-no\-initial\-sync\fR
Do not connect to JACK, nor use any other sync
source at application start.
.TP
\fB\-K\fR <int>, \fB\-\-keyframe\-limit\fR <int>
Specify a maximum key\-frame interval limit.
With most video codecs, a video frame is the sum
of a key\-frame plus differences from the closest
key\-frame.
For non continuous playback and random seeks
xjadeo will have to go back to a key\-frame and
decode sequentially to the target frame.
This can be quite CPU intense and hence the max.
sequential decoding sequence is limited. By
default to 100 frames
For fast frame accurate seeks, it is highly
recommended to transcode the video file using a
codec where every frame is a key\-frame (eg. mjpeg),
and the video consists only of "intra" frames.
(the key\-frame interval is sometimes also called
"group of pictures"s or GOP).
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-ltc\fR
Sync to Linear Time Code (audio jack).
.TP
\fB\-M\fR <int>, \fB\-\-midifps\fR <int>
Specify MTC conversion mode:
.TP
0:
use frame\-rate from MTC clock (default)
.TP
1:
use video file's fps
.TP
2:
"resample" file's fps / MTC
.TP
\fB\-m\fR <port>, \fB\-\-midi\fR <port>
Use MTC as sync source
The <port> argument is midi driver specific:
.TP
jack\-midi:
specify a midi port name to connect to,
.TP
or "" to not auto connect.
alsa\-seq:  specify ID to connect to (\fB\-1\fR: none)
.TP
eg. \fB\-m\fR ardour or \fB\-m\fR 80
alsa\-raw:  specify hardware device
.TP
eg. \fB\-m\fR hw:1,0 or \fB\-m\fR 1
portmidi:  numeric id; \fB\-1\fR: autodetect
.TP
a value > \fB\-1\fR specifies the port number to use.
use '\-v \fB\-m\fR \fB\-1\fR' to list midi ports.
.TP
\fB\-O\fR <port>, \fB\-\-osc\fR <port>
Listen for OSC messages on the given port.
Xjadeo can be remote controlled using Open Sound
Control. For a list of available commands, please
see the source code or online documentation.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR <val>, \fB\-\-offset\fR <val>
Time offset video from timecode source. This allows
one to offset the video playback a certain number
of (video) frames relative to the time source.
Positive and negative values are permitted.
The offset van be specified either as integer frame
number of as colon separated timecode.
.TP
\fB\-\-osc\-doc\fR
Print available OSC commands and exit.
.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-mq\fR
Enable POSIX realtime message queues.
This sets up a communication channel for remote,
intended to be used with `xjremote`.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
inhibit usual output.
.TP
\fB\-R\fR, \fB\-\-remote\fR
Enable interactive remote control mode
using standard I/O. This option implies non\-verbose
and quiet as the terminal is used for interaction.
.TP
\fB\-r\fR <file>, \fB\-\-rc\fR <file>
Specify a custom configuration file to load.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR, \fB\-\-no\-splash\fR
Skip the on screen display startup sequence.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-fullscreen\fR
Start xjadeo in full screen mode.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR <file>, \fB\-\-ttf\-file\fR <file>
path to .ttf font for on screen display
.TP
\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-\-uuid\fR
specify JACK SESSION UUID.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-W\fR <rpc\-id>, \fB\-\-ipc\fR <rpc\-id>
Setup IPC message queues for remote control
Inter Process Communication is used by `xjremote`
on OSX and other platforms that do not support
realtime message queues
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
print more information
.TP
\fB\-x\fR <int>, \fB\-\-vo\fR <int>, \fB\-\-videomode\fR <int>
Select a video output mode (default: 0: autodetect)
A value of \fB\-1\fR lists the available mode and exits

If neither \fB\-m\fR nor \fB\-l\fR options are given, xjadeo synchronizes to jack transport
by default.
.PP
.SH "Video Codecs and Formats:"
Xjadeo uses ffmpeg to decode video files, so a wide range of formats and codecs
are supported. Note however that not all the codecs support reliable seeking.
It is highly recommended to transcode the video file into a suitable
format/codec. The recommend combination is avi/mjpeg.
e.g. ffmpeg \fB\-i\fR input\-file.xxx \fB\-an\fR \fB\-vcodec\fR mjpeg output\-file.avi
This creates from your input\-file.xxx an AVI mjpeg encoded video file without
sound, and no compression between frames (motion jpeg \- every frame is a
key\-frame). You may want also to shrink the size of the file by scaling down
its geometry. This uses fewer system resources for decoding and display and
leaves more space on the screen for your audio software.
see ffmpeg \fB\-s\fR <width>x<height> option and read up on the ffmpeg man page
for further options. e.g. \fB\-qscale\fR 0 to retain image quality.
.PP
.SH "Configuration Files:"
At startup xjadeo reads the following resource configuration files in the
following order:
.TP
system wide:
\fI\,/etc/xjadeorc\/\fP or \fI\,/usr/local/etc/xjadeorc\/\fP
.TP
old user config:
$HOME/.xjadeorc
.TP
user config:
\fI\,$XDM_CONFIG_HOME/xjadeo/xjadeorc\/\fP (usually $HOME/.config/)
.TP
on OSX:
\fI\,$HOME/Library/Preferences/xjadeorc\/\fP
.TP
on Windows:
$HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH\exjadeorc
.TP
and $HOMEDRIVE$HOMEPATH\eLocal Settings\exjadeorc
(usually C:\eDocuments and Settings\e<Username>\e)
.TP
project specific:
\fI\,$PWD/xjadeorc\/\fP
.PP
Every line in the configuration file is a KEY=VALUE pair. If the first
character on a line is either is a literal '#' or ';', the line is ignored.
KEYS are case insensitive. Boolean values are specified as 'yes' or 'no'.
As for a list of available keys, please see the example configuration file,
which is available in the documentation folder of the source code.
.PP
If xjadeo is compiled with jack session support, it will save its current
state as config file and pass it as handle to the jack session manager.
.PP
.SH "User Interaction:"
The xjadeo window offers a right\-click context menu (except on OSX where the
application has a main menu bar) which provides easy access to common
functionality.
On OSX and Windows this menu offers a file open dialog to change the video file
that is being monitored. On Linux new files can be loaded by dragging the file
onto the window itself.
In addition xjadeo reacts to key presses. The following shortcuts are defined:
